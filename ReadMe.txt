The project runs a 2048 game. 
The Main2048.py contains the main driver program and the Logic.py contains the code with logistics of the movement of cells and overall logic of the game. 
Testing-Debugging.py just contains some testing code that I ran to debug the logic of the game. 
UI_Constants.py contains constant values used for defining colors and frame sizes for the game. To move the cells, 'wasd' keys are used. UI images contain some images of me playing and testing the game.
